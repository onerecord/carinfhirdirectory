# CARIN HL7&reg; FHIR&reg; Directory

This directory is designed to help consumer-facing applications have what is needed to easily discover and connect to HL7® FHIR® endpoints. Additionally, it will crowdsource HL7® FHIR® endpoints from various data holders as a free public service and direct application developers to other private sector efforts who are providing HL7® FHIR® endpoint directory services (e.g., validation, certification, etc.) using the CARIN HL7® FHIR® Directory Framework.
